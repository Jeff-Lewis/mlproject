function [ faceCoord ] = window_slide(imgMat, model)
%window_slide uses a sliding window method to search for faces in an image
%   imgMat is a matrix representation of an image
%   model is a vector of learned coefficients for a classifier
%   faceCoord is a matrix of the same size as imgMat with 1/0 indicating
%   wither or not a pixel is part of a face/no face

%Initialize return matrix
faceCoord = zeros(size(imgMat));

%Set default patch size

%Set patch sizes to search with:
patchSizeRatios = [0.5 1 2 5 10 15];

%Search step size ratio

%Find size of image

%loop for multiple patch sizes
